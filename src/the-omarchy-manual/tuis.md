# 终端界面 (TUIs)

## Lazygit

[Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is a delightful alternative to something like the GitHub Desktop application, and it runs inside the terminal.

You can run it directly, by going to any directory managed by git and running `lazygit`. Or you can run it inside Neovim where it can be started with `Space G G`.

You hop between the different panes using `Tab`. In the Files pane, you select files for staging using `Space`, and then you can create a new commit using `c`. You can see all the commands available using `?`.

## Lazydocker

[Lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) is made in the same spirit like Lazygit, and also gives you a terminal interface for managing your containers and images.

You can start it with `Super + Shift + D`.

You stop a container using `s` or start/restart it using `r`. See all commands using `?`.

## Btop

[Btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) is a beautiful resource manager that shows memory, CPU, disk, and network usage. It also lists all active processes, and allows you to manage them.

Omarchy has added an app for it called Activity, which you can start from the application launcher. But it's quicker to just hit `Super + Shift + T`.

## Impala

[Impala](https://github.com/pythops/impala) is a TUI for managing your Wi-Fi connection. You hop between sections on tab, then select a network with space. If a password is needed, just input and hit return. It's available by clicking the Wi-Fi icon in the top menu bar.

## Fastfetch

[Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) shows system information, like kernel version, uptime, theme, CPU, memory, and more. It's a successor to the popular neofetch tool.

Omarchy has packaged this as _About_ in the Omarchy menu (`Super + Alt + Space`).
